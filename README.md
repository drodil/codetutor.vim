# codetutor.vim

:heart: Made with love for vim :heart:

This project is sort of "extension" to the original vimtutor. It's main
point is to concentrate on basic vim commands as well as commands used
most of the time when doing programming with vim. It also covers more
advanced things such as macros, marks, registers and so on.

Completing this tutor doesn't make you pro vim user yet but it's absolutely
a good starting point. If you are new to vim I suggest you complete
vimtutor at least once to get idea of the basic movement before starting
this tutor.

All lessons in the tutor are created based on my learning journey to
vim. As I am not expert (yet) on this matter all contributions are
welcome. You can find my blog post about crash course to vim at
https://medium.com/@drodil/my-vim-crashcourse-1d50d4e9d558

## HOWTO

Just open up the codetutor with (of course) vim (to be clear, run
command: 'vim codetutor'). If you are missing installation of vim
I suggest you install it first :grin:

## TODO

* More programming specific lessons under lesson 4
    * Commenting source code
* Working with version control
* Abbrevations lesson
* Examples of creating .vimrc
* Make this tutor a vim plugin
* References to :help from different lessons
